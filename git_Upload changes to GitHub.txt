Upload changes from your local repository to GitHub:

1. Show the status of your changes:
$ git status

2. Show the changes in your local repository:
$ git diff

3. Add the changes (add it to the Index) to do commit:
$ git add * 
or
$ git add .

#This is the first step in the basic git workflow.

4. To actually commit these changes use:
$ git commit -m "Se agrega cliente Rest con Feign para consumir productos"

#Now the files are committed to the HEAD, but NOT in your REMOTE repository yet (in GitHub).

5. To send those changes to your remote repository, execute:
$ git push origin master

6. Finally, refresh your repository in GitHub and view the changes.
