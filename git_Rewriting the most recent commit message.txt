Rewriting the most recent commit message


1. On the command line, navigate to the repository that contains the commit you want to amend.

2. Type git commit --amend and press Enter, It will open a ext editor like <vi>.

3. Edit the commit message, and save the commit. The new commit and message will appear on GitHub the next time you push.

4. If you have already pushed the commit to GitHub, you will have to force push a commit with an amended message:
$ git push --force
