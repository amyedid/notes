1. Go to the directory where you wish to have the repository (directory)

2. Clone a repository with git clone <url>.  With other VCS systems such as Subversion, the command is "clone" and not "checkout".

$ git clone https://github.com/amyedid/springboot-servicio-productos.git

3. The repository now is created in your local hard disk.
