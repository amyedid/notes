 Discard all but save local changes

1. To save what you had done, swap to another branch, commit, push, test, then get back to previous feature branch:
$ git stash

2. To redoes previously stashed changes and removes them from stashed list:
$ git stash pop

The stash command also has various additional options like:
	git stash save, which enables including temporary commit message, which will help you identify changes, among with other options
	git stash list, which lists all previously stashed commits (yes, there can be more) that were not poped
	git stash apply, which redoes previously stashed changes, but keeps them on stashed list
